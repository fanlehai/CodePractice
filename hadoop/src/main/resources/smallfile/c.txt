CFInputFormat.java

The CFInputFormat.java doesn’t do much. You implement createRecordReader to pass in the record reader that does the combine file logic, that’s all. Note that you can call setMaxSplitSize in the initializer to control the size of each chunk of files; if you don’t want to split files into half, remember to return false in isSplitable method, which defaults to true.
