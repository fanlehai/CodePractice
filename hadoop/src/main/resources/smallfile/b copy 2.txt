CombineFileInputFormat

The code listed here is modified from Hadoop example code. To use CombineFileInputFormat you need to implement three classes. The class CombineFileInputFormat is an abstract class with no implementation, so you must create a subclass to support it; we’ll name the subclass CFInputFormat. The subclass will initiate a delegate CFRecordReader that extends RecordReader; this is the code that does the file processing logic. We’ll also need a class for FileLineWritable, which replaces LongWritable normally used as a key to file lines.
